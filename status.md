# **ClaimScope: Project Status & Roadmap**

This document tracks the progress of this project. Each step includes a status indicator and a short description.

## **Roadmap Overview**

1. **Data Generation**   
    
        Done âœ…
    **Description**: Create a synthetic insurance dataset reflecting realistic claim scenarios, including fraud patterns, seasonal effects, and missing data.  
----

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
        
        Done âœ…
   - **Description**: Perform initial data checks, descriptive statistics, and visualizations to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and fraud indicators.  
----

3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** 

        Done âœ…
   - **Description**: Handle missing values, outliers, and noise. Craft new features (e.g., time between incident and report, text-based indicators from notes) to improve fraud detection.  
----

4. **Model Training & Evaluation** 

        Done âœ…
   - **Description**: Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). Evaluate performance using precision, recall, AUC, and confusion matrices.  

----

5. **Model Explainability**  

        In Progress ðŸš§
   - **Description**: Use tools like SHAP or LIME to understand which features drive the modelâ€™s fraud predictions and to build trust in the solution.  

----

6. **Deployment**

        To-Do ðŸ“‹
   - **Description**: Package the best-performing model into a web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask). Provide a dashboard to upload new claims and see predicted fraud risk.  

----

7. **Documentation** 

        To-Do ðŸ“‹
   - **Description**: Finalize project documentation.  

----

8. **Maintenance & Future Enhancements**

        To-Do ðŸ“‹
   - **Description**: Plan for model monitoring, retraining schedules, and additional features (such as advanced NLP on adjuster notes or real-time streaming).
